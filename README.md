# Docker-file
Docker is a platform that enables you to develop, ship, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that package your application and its dependencies, making it easier to ensure consistency across different environments. Here are some key concepts:

#Images: Read-only templates used to create containers. They contain everything needed to run an application, including code, libraries, and environment variables.

#Containers: Instances of Docker images. They are isolated environments that run your applications.

#Dockerfile: A text file that contains a series of instructions for building a Docker image. It specifies the base image, commands to install dependencies, and how to run the application.

#Docker Hub: A cloud-based registry where you can find and share Docker images.

#Volumes: Used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. They allow data to exist outside the container lifecycle.

#Networking: Docker allows containers to communicate with each other and with the outside world through various networking modes.
